# Test File for Claude Action

This is a test file to verify that our GitHub Actions fixes work correctly.

## What we fixed:
- Added `pull-requests: write` permission to GitHub Actions
- Fixed critical TypeORM import issues
- Created missing OrderItem entity
- Resolved database configuration conflicts

## Expected behavior:
When Claude is mentioned with `@claude` in this PR, the GitHub Action should:
1. ✅ Have proper write permissions
2. ✅ Create a branch successfully
3. ✅ Execute Claude Code without errors
4. ✅ Post responses to the PR

Let's test this! @claude please review this PR and test the GitHub Action functionality.
